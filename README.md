# Dynamic-systems-estimation-and-control-1
Assignment for Simulation & Modeling of Dynamical Systems focusing on real-time estimation and control. 
Part 1 implements gradient and Lyapunov-based (parallel & mixed) estimators on a mass–spring–damper model, comparing constant vs. sinusoidal excitation and studying noise sensitivity.  Findings include good output tracking, convergence behavior of parameters, and a notable error jump with stabilization at higher noise levels. 
Part 2 designs a roll-angle controller for an aircraft with transformed errors (z_1, z_2), adds Lyapunov-based online parameter estimation and disturbance tests.  Includes simulations, plots, and concise commentary.
